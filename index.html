        <p>
          From New York to Nairobi, São Paulo to Seoul, these evocative
          photographs capture the neon-lit landscapes of some of the world’s
          most iconic cities. Korean photographer <span>Kim Sung-min</span> took
          portraits of strangers he met during chance encounters on the street.
          His visual record serves as a reminder of the intimate connection
          between humans and the urban landscapes they live in.
